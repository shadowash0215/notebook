# Final Exam

**Symbol**: In this papar, $\mathrm{i}$ means $\sqrt{-1}$, $\omega$ means $\dfrac{-1 + \sqrt{-3}}{2}$. When $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$, $\mathcal{O}_K$ means the ring of integers of $K$. And $p$ is always a odd prime.

**Attention**: Promblem 1, 2 and 3 are the required problems. Problem 4, 5, 6 and 7 are the optional problems. You should choose one of 4, 5 and the other from 6, 7.

!!! question
    (1) (i) Define $\mathbb{Z}[\mathrm{i}]$.  
    (ii) State the Division Theorem in $\mathbb{Z}[\mathrm{i}]$.  
    (iii) Give all the integer solutions of $x^3 = y^2 + 1$.


    (2) Does the equation

    \[
        x^2 \equiv 13 \pmod {43^2 \times 61^3}
    \]

    have a solution? Clarify your answer.

    (3) (i) Give the fundamental solution of the standard Pell equation $x^2 - 2y^2 = 1$.  
    (ii) Give the complete solution of the standard Pell equation $x^2 - 2y^2 = 1$.  
    (iii) Give the complete solution of the generalized Pell equation $x^2 - 2y^2 = 7$.

    (4) Prove that the group $(\mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ always has a generator. (Hint: Consider the $\bmod p$ map $\varphi: (\mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z})^{\times} \rightarrow (\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ which send $n \bmod p^2$ to $n \bmod p$.)

    (5) $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-5})$.  
    (i) What is $\mathcal{O}_K$?  
    (ii) Give an example that the number in $\mathcal{O}_K$ cannot be **uniquely** factorized into **irreducible** elements and clarify your answer.  
    (iii) Factorize the ideal $(6)$ into prime ideals in $\mathcal{O}_K$ and compute the norm of each prime ideal.

    (6) Give the complete integer solutions of equation $x^2 + y^2 = 2z^2$.

    (7) (i) Prove that if $p \equiv 1 \pmod 3$, then $p$ is not a prime in $\mathbb{Z}[\omega]$.  
    (ii) Under which condition, $x^2 + xy + y^2 = p$ has a solution in $\mathbb{Z}$?  
    (Hint: Consider the process we prove the equavialet condition of $x^2 + y^2 = p$ has a solution in $\mathbb{Z}$.)
